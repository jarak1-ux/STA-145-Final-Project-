# STA-145-Final-Project
My replication package for my STA-145 final project. I took the discography of songs from the "Top 200 Best Songs of the 2010s" and analyzed the beat of each song, whether another artist had sampled each song, the virality of each song, and the "tempo". I sought to figure out if the explicitness of each song had a significant relationship to the certification category of each song. 

# Instructions
To access and utikize the script, open the "STA145-JARAK.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "UPDATED FINAL PROJ DATASET - Sheet1(2).csv file.

# Data
The data collected for this project were songs from the website Pitchfork which contained the 200 Best Songs of the 2010s. Being apart of this list implicated that these songs were the most popular because of variables such as tempo, rythmn, language, etc. The primary goal of the analysis was to determine whether there was a significant relationship between a song's explicitness and its certification category. I analyzed their discography by taking into account each song's length in 

# Operationalization
To operationalize the level of explicitness, I went to Spotify and listened to each individual song where I calculated the amount of times innapropriate language was used. 

To operationalize song certification, I went to who.sampled.com where it determined the highest level of certification each song recieved.
